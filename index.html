  <h5>About</h5>
  Hello! I am a Master’s student in <b>Transportation and Highway Engineering</b> at <b><a href="https://www.lsu.edu/">Louisiana State University (LSU)</a></b>, where I serve as a Graduate Research Assistant on an LTRC-funded project focused on evaluating the noise and vibration impact of <b>longitudinal rumble strips</b>.

  <br><br>
  My work involves experimental design, site selection, field testing, and acoustic/vibration analysis using AASHTO and SAE standards. I’ve presented at the <b>TRB 104th Annual Meeting</b> and won <b>2nd place</b> in the Graduate Student Research Conference (GSRC) at LSU.

  <br><br>
  I hold a B.Sc. in Civil Engineering from <b><a href="https://www.just.edu.jo/">Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST)</a></b>, where I ranked <b>2nd out of 126 students</b>. My graduation project involved using <b>machine learning to predict crash severity</b> and performing <b>hotspot analysis of traffic accidents</b>.

  <br><br>
  I also completed a competitive, paid summer internship in <b>Austria</b>, working on laser scanning, GPS surveying, and 3D/2D mapping.
